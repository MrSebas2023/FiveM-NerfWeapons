# FiveM-NerfWeapons
Fivem resource to nerf weapon damage.

I have found multiple people looking for a resource to nerf weapon damage in FiveM
Decided to relearse this very simple resource that can help them!

To add more weapons use template below
N_0x4757f00bc6323cfe(GetHashKey([Weapon spawn name]), 0.4)
Wait(0)

For the multiplier i used 0.4 this means that the damage of the weaapon equals to the normal damages x the multiplier
Example: Normal weapon damage = -20 Health
With a 0.4 multiplier the modified weapon damage will be: -20 x 0.4 = -8 Health

Use this however you like.
